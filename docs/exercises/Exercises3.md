## Network Security

1. Investigate the network access control scheme used at your school or place of employment (if you work somewhere). Draw a diagram and describe the principal components. **This question has an aim to make you investigate and there is no uniform answer. You are strongly encouraged to ask our guest lecturer about our University access control.**

2. Explain DNS cache poisoning.

3. What is SamSam malware? How deos it work? What are the famous ransomware attacks in the UK?

4. Should I use DoH or DoT? Convince me!

5. What is the purpose of HTTPS?

6. What is the goal of the TCP session hijacker? How can we prevent it? 

7. For what applications is SSH useful?

8. What is the difference between SYN Flooding Attack and TCP session hijacking? Can we prevent them? How? 

10. Where does IPsec reside in a protocol stack?

11. What is DHCP? How useful is it to help achieve security of IP addresses?

12. How does ARP Spoofing facilitate MITM attack?  

13. Is Wireless networking more susceptible to eavesdropping and jamming than wired networks? Elaborate! Why/why not?

14. What was the largest DDoS attack of all time? Is it still the largest? Investigate! What are other famous DDoS attack? Can you explain how they were performed?

15. In IEEE 802.11, open system authentication simply consists of two communications. An authentication is requested by the client, which contains the station ID (typically the MAC address). This is followed by an authentication response from the AP/router containing a success or failure message. An example of when a failure may occur is if the clientâ€™s MAC address is explicitly excluded in the AP/router configuration.
a. What are the benefits of this authentication scheme?
b. What are the security vulnerabilities of this authentication scheme?
