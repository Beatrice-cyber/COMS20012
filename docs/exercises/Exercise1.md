6. The HF Corporation has a new refrigerator, the Monitator, which has a camera that takes a picture of the contents of the refrigerator and uploads it to the HF Corporation’s web site. The Monitator’s owner can then access this web site to see what is inside their refrigerator without opening the door. For security reasons, the HF Corporation encrypts this picture using a proprietary algorithm and gives the 4-digit PIN to decrypt this picture to the Monitator’s owner, so he or she can get access to the pictures of their Monitator’s interior. What are the security concerns and principles that this solution does and doesn’t support?
7. Consider a desktop publishing system used to produce documents for various organizations.
